Mary had a little lamb, little lamb,
little lamb, Mary had a little lamb
whose fleece was white as snow.
And everywhere that Mary went
Mary went, Mary went, everywhere
that Mary went
The lamb was sure to go.

He followed her to schol one day,
schol one day, schol one day,
He followed her to schol one day,
Which was against the rules,
It made the children laugh and pley,
laugh and pley, laugh and pley,
It made the children laugh and pley,
To see a lamb at schol
